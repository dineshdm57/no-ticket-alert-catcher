# No-Ticket Alert Catcher Workflow

This workflow detects alerts fired in your monitoring tools (such as Datadog or Prometheus) that do not have corresponding tasks created in your task management systems (Jira, Monday, or ServiceNow). It helps to ensure that no alert goes unaddressed by linking alerts to actionable tasks.

### Problem:
Alerts are often triggered automatically from monitoring systems, but they donâ€™t always result in the creation of a corresponding task in systems like Jira, Monday, or ServiceNow. This can lead to unresolved issues, missed incidents, or incidents not being tracked properly.

### Solution:
This workflow checks every alert to see if a task exists for it. If a task does not exist, it sends a notification to Slack to inform the team to create a task for the alert. This ensures that each alert leads to a concrete action and improves incident resolution efficiency.

### Key Features:
- **Prevents untracked alerts** by linking monitoring alerts to task management systems.
- **Automates alert-to-task validation**, reducing manual work.
- **Boosts incident response times** by ensuring that no alert is left unresolved.
- **Integrates seamlessly** with monitoring tools (like Datadog) and ticketing systems (Jira, Monday, ServiceNow).

### Workflow Steps:

1. **Schedule Trigger**
   - The workflow runs on a scheduled basis to automatically check for new alerts in your monitoring system at set intervals.
   
2. **Fetch Recent Alerts**
   - The workflow fetches the list of active or recent alerts from your monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog or Prometheus).

3. **Check If Ticket Exists**
   - The workflow checks if a task exists for each alert by querying the integrated ticketing system (Jira, Monday, or ServiceNow).

4. **Condition Check**
   - The workflow checks if a corresponding task has been created. If a task exists, the workflow ends. If no task exists, it moves to the next step.

5. **Send Slack Notification**
   - If no task is found for an alert, a notification is sent to a designated Slack channel, alerting the team to take action and create a task for the unresolved alert.

### How to Use:
1. **Import the workflow** into your OpenOps workspace by uploading the exported JSON file.
2. **Configure the connections** to your monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog) and ticketing systems (e.g., Jira).
3. **Set up the schedule** to check for new alerts at regular intervals.
4. **Monitor the Slack notifications** to ensure that untracked alerts are promptly addressed.

### Requirements:
- OpenOps account
- Monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus)
- Ticketing systems (Jira, Monday, or ServiceNow)
- Slack integration for notifications
